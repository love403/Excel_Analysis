### Project Overview

This project aims to analyze Road Accident Data. It provides insights into the factors causing the high rate of road accident casualties and how to regulate them to ensure the safety of road users.

### Data Sources

Road Accident Data; The primary dataset used for this analysis is the “road_accident_data.csv” file, containing detailed information about road accident rates and the total casualties. 

### Tools
- Excel-Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Visualisation.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, I performed the following tasks;
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling typo/spelling errors.
3. Data cleaning and Formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

A Pivot table was used in analyzing the data to answer the following key questions;
1. The total Casualties.
2.Total Casualties to Accident Severity.
3. Total Casualties to Vehicle Type.
4. Current year vs Previous year Casualties Monthly Trend.
5. Total Casualties by Road Type and Road Surface.
6. Relationship between Casualties by Area/Location and Day/Night.

### Results and Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows;
- The highest number of casualties was recorded on the
   - “Car” Vehicle Type,
   - “Single carriageway” Road type,
   - “Dry” Road Surface,
   - “Urban” Area and more by “Daylight”.
- Relationship between the previous and current year; The number of Casualties recorded in the previous year(2021) was higher than the current year(2022). Road accidents drastically reduced over the year.

### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions;
 - The road safety corps and Police Force needs to ensure that all road users adhere to the road traffic rules.
 - There should be a 24/7 equipped paramedics and emergency services department to ensure all casualties gets an immediate first aids treatment at the spot to reduce accident severity.
 - An awareness and publicity should be created so all road users can have a proper knowledge of the road transport rules.

### Limitations

I had to create a new column titled month and year in the data set, to enable me get the monthly trend for current and previous year, I also used the field items set on the pivot table to group some of items in columns like light conditions, vehicle type and road surface to target effective analysis of data.
